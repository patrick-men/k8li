# ToDo

A list of open ToDos:

- Add `edit` to default actions
- ~~Ensure that the output for non-prepped resources is correct. E.g. `machines` causes the prompt `resources: <namespace>` > better handling of the output of the respective kubectl commands.~~
- ~~Add the entirety of the kubectl output to fzf, but then only use the name. This way every command is an implicit `kubectl get`, since fzf always shows all infos~~
